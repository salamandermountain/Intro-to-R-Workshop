## Intro to R Workshop

These materials were created for the USU Ecology Center Workshop on R, Github, and Reproducible Science. Part 1, on R, is best done with active participation from workshop participants as they follow along with the script. Part 2, on Reproducible Science, is best done by walking through the powerpoint and then a demonstration of linking RStudio and git.
